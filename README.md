## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting and predicting credit card fraud, a significant concern affecting hundreds of thousands of people annually. Using a comprehensive dataset containing over one million credit card transaction entries, including cases of reported fraud, we applied various data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and indicators of fraudulent activities.

## Project Files
- `project_3.R`: This R script includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of different models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees to predict credit card fraud.
- `project.py`: A Python script that complements the R analysis with additional data processing, model training using machine learning techniques, and evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the models.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains one million entries of credit card transactions with over eighty-seven thousand reported fraud cases. It includes metadata such as the distance from the account's address, transaction history, and purchase patterns.

## Hypothesis
The project hypothesizes that the deviation from the median transaction value and the location relative to the card's registered address are significant indicators of fraud.

## Models and Analysis
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and specific case studies to understand the effectiveness in detecting fraud.

## Requirements
- R and its libraries: caret, ggplot2, rpart, pROC, dplyr
- Python and its libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow

## Setup and Execution
1. Install the necessary R and Python libraries.
2. Run `project_3.R` for the R-based analysis and modeling.
3. Execute `project.py` for the Python-based data processing and model evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into credit card fraud detection using data analysis and machine learning models. The findings have significant implications for reducing fraud and protecting consumers and businesses alike.
